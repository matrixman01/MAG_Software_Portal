# License of MAG Software Portal

This license is written just in case. It's only a hobby project so don't take it really seriously ;)

1. As *MAG Software Portal* I mean all data stored in GitHub repository: https://github.com/Nepose/MAG_Software_Portal. Website of project - https://nepose.github.io - is also stored as repository, but it is managed by separated license which you can read at its repository.
2. MAG Software Portal is based on partly open source utilities (further meant as *components* which are developed by other manufacturer - Infomir. I don't describe license of these utilities, I describe only license of my end product.
3. You are allowed to use my product in any using and do anything which is allowed by Git (GitHub) rules.
4. If you want to:
* get source code (components of product),
* do other firmware basing on my product and/or release it,
* modify anything in my product which exceeds fair using (e.g. modyfing sensitive parts of source code and/or compiling your one),
* collaborate with me,
* do anything not allowed by law,
just say it to me, please :) As I've written to you in readme, I don't bite. Really ;)
5. On the situations that aren't described here or in any part of MAG Software Portal, follow my guides, Infomir guides, GitHub rules and local law.
