# MAG Software Portal
Customized firmware for MAG 245/250, Aura HD, Aura HD International and IP_STB_HD (variant of 250 developed by Rostelecom) Feel free to ask, use or do anything good :)

## Why using it instead official soft?
Because Infomir stopped servicing all STBs from first line. As "first line" I mean boxes with stm processor expect MAG256 (particularly MAG 200, 245, 250, 254, 270, 275 and Aura HD, Aura HD International). A nice surprise was r23 update after a year of mute ;) And I'll put more functions here. It is also a nice lesson of programming for me so if you're able, please help me realising my hobby and join in project :D

## How to install and update?
There are several methods of doing it, I'll describe here USB & Bootstrap.
