# MAG Software Portal
Customized firmware for Infomir IPTV STBs: MAG 245/250, 254, 322/324, Aura HD, Aura HD International and IP_STB_HD (variant of 250 developed by Rostelecom) Feel free to ask, use or do anything good :)

## Why using it instead official soft?
Because Infomir stopped servicing all STBs from first line. As "first line" I mean boxes with stm processor expect MAG256 (particularly MAG 200, 245, 250, 254, 270, 275 and Aura HD, Aura HD International). A nice surprise was r23 update after a year of mute ;) And I'll put more functions here. It is also a nice lesson of programming for me so if you're able, please help me realising my hobby and join in project :D
You can find changelog at *misc* -> *Changelog.md* file.

## How to install and do update?
There are several methods of doing it depending on STB model. you will find everything at *Misc* -> *Install guides*

## Where to download?
* Images 2.19 and newer (release channel) you can find at Releases.
* Images 2.18.26 and older (beta channel) you can find at *Older images* directory.

## Can I use it on my box?
If it's from manufacturer / shop / etc. - **yeah**. Images are signed with standard public key. But if your box is from provider, it can use customized firmware signed by itself. You just would have to try and check, I can't make sure whether there wouldn't be Wrong Signature error.

## FAQ
You can find FAQs at *misc* -> *FAQ.md*.

## What is *misc*?
It's a directory with all miscellaneous stuff, such as documentation, changelogs and licenses. I wanted to make it simple and don't do any blockings at main site :)

## But remember!
You do everything on your own responsibility! ;) If you'd like to ask something, just ask, I don't bite ;)
