# MAG Software Portal
Customized firmware for Infomir IPTV STBs: MAG 245/250, 254, 322/324, Aura HD, Aura HD International and IP_STB_HD (variant of 250 developed by Rostelecom). Project website: https://nepose.github.io

## Why using it instead official soft?
Because Infomir stopped servicing all STBs from first line. As "first line" I mean boxes with stm processor expect MAG256 (particularly MAG 200, 245, 250, 254, 270, 275 and Aura HD, Aura HD International). A nice surprise was r23 update after a year of mute ;) And I'll put more functions here. It is also a nice lesson of programming for me so if you're able, please help me realising my hobby and join in project :D

## How to install and do update?
You can find guides for each STB at project wiki.

## Where to download?
* Release imageupdates and patches 2.19.00 and newer you can find at *Releases* card at main menu of repository.
* Images 2.18.26 and older (beta channel) you can find at *Older images* directory.

## Can I use it on my box?
If it's from manufacturer / shop / etc. - **yeah**. Images are signed with standard public key. But if your box is from provider, it can use customized firmware signed by itself. You just would have to try and check, I can't make sure whether there wouldn't be Wrong Signature error.

## Where can I find project documentation?
Just follow project wiki. Here is all miscellaneous documentation and stuff.

## Is there any license or document like it?
I'm not sure if it's needed, it's only a hobby project ;) But there is a license just in case.

## But remember!
You do everything on your own responsibility! ;) If you'd like to ask something, just ask, I don't bite ;)
